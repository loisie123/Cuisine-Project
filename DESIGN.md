Technical Design


For making this application I am going to use two classes:
-	Meals
-	Weak

These will consist of:

Classe meals:
-	Name
-	Likes

Classe weaks
-	Day
-	Meals


The UIViewcontrollers that I am going to make are:
-	Login users
-	register
-	Menu users
-	Todays meals
-	Tomorrow meals
-	Meals I like
-	Login Caterer
-	Menu caterer
-	feedback
-	Add meals view


No external data sources will be used. All data that will be used are gathered by the users. 

A firebase database will be made. Where both users and the caterer will be able to login. 
Data that is saved by the caterer should be seen by everyone. 
Every like should be seen by everyone.
