## Naming

### General

- Clarity at the point of use. 
- Use US English spelling to match Apple's API.
- Clear naming and avoid ambigous words.
- Do not abbreviate, use shortened names, or single letter names.
- Using names based on roles not on types
- Every word  in a name should convey salient information.
- Protocols that describe what something is should read as nouns.
- protocols that describe a capability should be names using suffixes.
- Stick to the established meaning. 
- Using terms that don't surprise experts or confuse beginners. 
- avoid abbreviations.
- Using camel case.
- Using uppercase for types (and protocols), lowercase for everything else. 


### Methods
- Name functions and methods according to their side affects.
- Uses of boolean methods and properties should read as assertions.
- Giving the same base nae to methods that share the same meaning.
- Begin factory methods with make.
